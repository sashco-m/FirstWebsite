<h3>The joys of woodworking</h3>
<p>What started off as a cute Valentine's day project ignited my interest in woodworking.
  I have always felt an immense sense of accomplishment working with my hands, such as when
  playing guitar. I began with deciding to use pine, as it is a very soft and light wood,
  perfect ergonomically for earrings. I cut off thin slices on a bandsaw, and drew out 
  a heart. After some time sanding, voila! I will be sure to continue to challenge
  myself in future projects </p>

  <p style="padding:2vw"> One of my friends, a Waterloo Architecture hopeful, has commissioned me to create a website for him to display his art. So far, I have enjoyed experimenting with layered css animations, and I hope to expand it further and ultimately use it to apply the Javascript that I am currently learning.</p>

    <h4>Created during the Canada Learning Code Hackathon at SBA</h4>
    <ul style="text-align:left;margin-top:-4vh;">
      <li>This website was designed to highlight a specific issue, and provide solutions</li>
      <li>We attempted to increase awareness of opportunities for kids to gain experience in engineering</li>
      <li>It was my first hackathon, so keep in mind it is a little rough around the edges!</li>
      <li>It provided great experience working under a strict timeframe, and delegating tasks effectively</li>
